### The abstract of the paper is given as following:
Topic modelling approaches such as LDA can often generate redundant topics from a tweet corpus, as they have difficulties to integrate such redundant multiple topics into a single ``real'' coherent topic. Therefore, in order to evaluate the quality of topic models from tweets, it is necessary to study metrics which calculate the similarities between the generated topics, for example, cosine similarity (CS) metrics. In addition to such commonly used metrics, we propose to compute the similarities of topics using word embeddings (WE). To examine how well these metrics align with human judgements, we conduct a crowdsourced user study. Our stud shows that CS and WE-based metrics can better align with human judgements compared to other metrics. In particular, we find that the cosine similarity and word embeddings-based metric are complementary. While the cosine similarity-based metric captures the topic similarity by words with high frequencies, the WE-based metric seeks for semantic similarity among topics. In short, our study offers insights into study measuring the similarity of latent topics on Twitter.
